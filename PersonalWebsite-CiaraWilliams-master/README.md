### Heroku Link

- https://ciarawilliams.herokuapp.com/index.html

<br>

### Landing Page

- the index.html file is the landing page for my personal website. It contains a nav bar that lets you go to all the other pages in my website. It is title Ciara's Personal Page which indicates that the website is all about me.

<br>
<br>

### Nav Element

- I have included a navbar in the landing page as my main navigational element. I have hyperlinks throughout the webpage to allow for easy navigation.

<br>
<br>

### Internal Links

- I have 3 additional html pages profile, resume, and hobbies. All are linked through the landing page navbar, and resume and hobbies are linked through the profile page through an overlay element done in css.

<br>
<br>

### External Links

- I have two external links. One can be found on my resume page and it is a button that links to my LinkedIn profile. The second is on my hobbies page that links to my favorite tea place Harney and Sons.

<br>
<br>

### HTML Tables

- I have several HTML tables throughout my project. The first and second are in the profile page. One is used to display basic information about me, the second is in the overlay to display the two internal links, resume and hobbies.

- The third is in my resume page to display my resume.

<br>

### Interactive in JS

- While I have many interactive elements the only one I could figure out how to do in JavaScript is in my resume page. It is the button that leads to my LinkedIn. If you mouseover the button it will change from green to red and then 200ms later will return to green. This is a repeatable animation.

<br>
<br>

### Responsiveness

- I have put in each of my css files the @media query for mobile devices. I then sized my elements using css to ensure that they were obvious and visible on both desktop and mobile.
